# Task 3/3: Fix typos, change the code to comply with naming rules and camelCase convention

In this task, you need to fix all typos in the file, change the names to comply with the camelCase naming convention, 
and rename entities according to the rules described in the previous lesson.

<div class="hint" title="Shortcut for Rename refactoring">
  Use the &shortcut:RenameElement; (macOS) or Shift+F6 (Windows/Linux) shortcut to rename a code element.
</div>

<div class="hint">

  - `getgradestatus` - method names should follow the сamelCase style, where every word except the first starts with an uppercase letter. Therefore, the correct name should be `getGradeStatus`.
  - `SetName` - method names should start with a lowercase letter. Therefore, the correct name should be `setName`.
  - `setaGe` - typos in the letter `a` and `G`, the correct name is `setAge`.
  - `setAvergeScore` - missing a letter, the correct name is `setAverageScore`.

</div>
