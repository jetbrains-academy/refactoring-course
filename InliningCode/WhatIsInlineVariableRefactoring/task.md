# Task 1/4: What is Inline Variable refactoring?

We apply **Inline refactoring** to simplify code by removing unnecessary method or variable declarations and directly 
replacing them with their respective expressions or values.

Apply Inline Variable when a variable is only used once or when its name does not add any meaningful information. 
If the variable does not contribute to code readability or logic, it can be inlined.

To apply Inline Method refactoring, select the code you want to inline and press &shortcut:Inline; hotkey.
