# Task 2/4: Inline Method refactoring

Apply Inline Method when a method's behavior is simple and its purpose is clear, but it is being called from only one place.
If the method has become redundant or does not add significant value, it can be safely inlined.

To apply Inline Method refactoring, select the code you want to inline and press &shortcut:Inline; hotkey.
