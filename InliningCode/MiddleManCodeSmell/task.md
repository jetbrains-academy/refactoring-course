# Task 3/4: Middle Man code smell

The Middle Man code smell refers to a situation in which a class or method acts as a simple intermediary,
forwarding calls to another class or method without adding any meaningful behavior or logic of its own. 
Essentially, the Middle Man does not provide any additional value and merely adds unnecessary abstraction,
making the code more complex and harder to understand.

Inline Method refactoring can help to resolve the Middle Man code smell by removing the unnecessary methods and
directly calling the target methods from the client classes. By inlining the methods, you eliminate the Middle Man 
and reduce the abstraction, leading to cleaner and more straightforward code.
