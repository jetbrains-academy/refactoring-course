One might say that one extra space or erratic usage of tabs instead of spaces and vice versa donâ€™t make any difference
and will be right if they work alone. In real life developers use control version systems to share their code with
colleagues and miscellaneous formatting makes code review process more complicated. Imagine you and your colleague
use different formatting style and your colleague makes a minor change in the code but then formats the code according
to their style. It will lead to the situation when you see that lots code lines changes but in fact only a couple of
lines contain functional changes. It is one of the examples why you should pay attention on formatting.
