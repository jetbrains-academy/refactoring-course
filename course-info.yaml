title: Refactoring Course

summary: |-
  This course will introduce you to refactorings and IDE features that would help you to perform them in an effective way. You will learn to recognise refactoring opportunities in code and how to deal with them. Using automatic IDE refactorings you will transform code to improve its structure, readability and maintainability.
  The course consists of N modules, each module focuses on one group of refactorings, provides short theory and several small tasks for practice. We will go forward from small local refactoring changes to the complex ones that affect project architecture.
