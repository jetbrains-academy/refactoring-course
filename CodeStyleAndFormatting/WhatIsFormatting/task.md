# Task: 1/4: What is formatting?

Code formatting refers to the arrangement of code, including indentation, spacing, line breaks, 
and other stylistic convention. Consistent indentation, clear spacing, and logical line breaks help developers 
quickly understand the code's structure, flow, and relationships between different code elements.

One of the examples that shows how lack of consistency might be confusing is code review process. 
In real life developers use control version systems to share their code with colleagues and miscellaneous formatting
makes code review process more complicated. Imagine you and your colleague use different formatting style and your 
colleague makes a minor change in the code but then formats the code according to their style. 
It will lead to the situation when you see that lots code lines changes but in fact only a couple of lines contain 
functional changes. It is one of the examples why you should pay attention on formatting.
