# Task 4/4: Change editor config

In this task, we will practice defining our custom settings in the .editorconfig file.

You need to create .editorconfig in the project, and define the following settings:
```
ident_style = space
ident_size = 4
```

Make sure that the source code complies with them, and if they donâ€™t, fix the issues.
