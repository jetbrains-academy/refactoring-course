# Task 4/4: Configure code style settings in IDE

In this task, we will practice defining our custom settings in the `.editorconfig` file.
The full list of **EditorConfig** properties is
available [here](https://github.com/editorconfig/editorconfig/wiki/EditorConfig-Properties).

You need to create `.editorconfig` in the project, and define the following settings:

- Indentation size is equal to 4;
- Indentation style is equal to space;
- Maximum line length is equal to 120;
- Add a newline character at the end of the last line in the file.

Make sure that the source code complies with them, and if they donâ€™t, fix the issues.

<div class="hint">

- `indent_size` - indentation size;
- `indent_style` - indentation style;
- `max_line_length` - forces hard line wrapping after the amount of characters specified;
- `insert_final_newline` - denotes whether file should end with a newline.

</div>
