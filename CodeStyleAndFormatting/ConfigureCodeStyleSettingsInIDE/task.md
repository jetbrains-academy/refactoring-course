# Task 4/4: Configure code style settings in IDE

In this task, we will practice defining our custom settings in the .editorconfig file.

You need to create .editorconfig in the project, and define the following settings:
```.editorconfig
indent_size = 4
indent_style = space
```

Make sure that the source code complies with them, and if they donâ€™t, fix the issues.
