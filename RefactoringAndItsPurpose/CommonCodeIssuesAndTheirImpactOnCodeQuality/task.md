# Task 2/4: Common code issues and their impact on code quality

Martin Fowler introduced a *code smell* term which is an indicator that code might have some issues or shortcomings 
in its implementation. That doesn’t necessarily mean that code has bugs, but it makes its understanding,

Resolving code smells via refactoring improves codebase’s quality and makes it more clear and extensible.

In this course, we will take a look at several code quality issues such as long methods, duplicated code, 
large class, feature envy.
