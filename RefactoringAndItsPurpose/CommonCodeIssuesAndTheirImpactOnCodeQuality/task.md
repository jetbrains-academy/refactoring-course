# Task 2/4: Common code issues and their impact on code quality

Martin Fowler introduced the **_code smell_** term, which indicates that code might have some issues or shortcomings in its
implementation. That doesn’t necessarily mean that code has bugs, but the smell makes code understanding, developing, and
maintenance much more complex.

Ignoring code smells leads to an increase of technical debt. Resolving code smells via
refactoring improves the codebase’s quality and makes it clearer and more extensible.

In this course, we will take a look at several code quality issues, such as long methods, duplicated code, large
classes, feature envy, and middle man.
