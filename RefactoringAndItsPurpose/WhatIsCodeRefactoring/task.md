# Task: 2/5: What is code refactoring

Refactoring is a process of modifying source code without changing its behaviour. 
For example, renaming a method or extracting a *magic constant* into a separate variable. 
It improves code readability, but doesn’t change what code does. 
The purpose of refactoring is to improve code readability and simplify its maintenance. 
Usually, software developers work in teams on code bases and spend considerable time on reading each other’s code,
that is why it is important to make you code clear and clean.
