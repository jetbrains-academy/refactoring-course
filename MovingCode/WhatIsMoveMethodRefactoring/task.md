# Task: 1/4: What is Move Method refactoring?

Next refactoring that we learn in this course is **Move refactoring** which is a process of moving a code entity from 
one place to a more appropriate place, making the codebase more organized and easier to understand. 
We apply **Move refactoring** when we want to improve structure of the code, enhancing its readability, 
maintainability, and extensibility.

For example, you can perform move refactoring on a function or a property if it is used more in another class 
than in its own class.
To perform move refactoring, you need to click on a code element 
you want to move and press &shortcut:DatabaseView.MoveToGroup; shortcut. 
When refactoring dialog appears, you need to specify the target class/package and click Refactor. 
It is also possible to see refactroing preview.
You can also Undo refactroing by pressing &shortcut:$Undo;.
