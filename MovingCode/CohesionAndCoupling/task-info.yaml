    is_correct: false
  - text: High cohesion and low coupling to create well-organized and maintainable code.
    is_correct: true
  - text: Low cohesion and low coupling to simplify code understanding.
    is_correct: false
  - text: Low cohesion and high coupling to increase code efficiency.
    is_correct: false
message_correct: Congratulations!
message_incorrect: "Incorrect solution. Explanation:
High cohesion means each module has a clear purpose, and low coupling minimizes how much modules rely on each other.
This improves how easy the code is to read, maintain, and adapt."
