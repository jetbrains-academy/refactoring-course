# Task 1/1: Facade Pattern - Theory

The Facade design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a simplified interface 
to a complex system of classes, libraries, or APIs. 
The Facade pattern creates a "facade" or wrapper class that encapsulates a set of classes and their interactions,
presenting a more straightforward and user-friendly API to clients.

**When to apply Facade pattern?** \
This pattern is beneficial when dealing with large systems, as it allows clients to interact with the system
through a single, well-defined interface.
