# Task 2/3: What is Extract Variable refactoring?

A *magic number* is a numerical value used in the code without explaining its purpose in the comment. 
Using magic numbers in code is considered bad practice because it makes the code less maintainable, readable, and prone to errors.

To resolve this problem, you can press &shortcut:IntroduceConstant; hotkey to create a constant variable 
with a meaningful name and use it in the code. 

If there are duplicated values in the code (string values or just lines of code),
you can use &shortcut:IntroduceVariable; hotkey to introduce a variable.
Alternatively, you can just type “.var” at the end of the value and press Enter. 
IDE will create a new variable and move the value to it.
