A *magic number* is a numerical value used in the code without a comment explaining its purpose. 
Using magic numbers in code is considered bad practice because it makes the code prone to errors and less maintainable and readable.

To resolve this problem, you can press the &shortcut:IntroduceConstant; shortcut to create a constant variable 
with a meaningful name and use it in the code. 

If there are duplicated values in the code (string values or just lines of code),
you can use the &shortcut:IntroduceVariable; shortcut to introduce a variable.
Alternatively, you can just type “.var” after the value and press Enter. 
The IDE will create a new variable and move the value to it.
